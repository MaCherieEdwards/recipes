Ingredients 

-4 large egg whites
-1/2 tsp distilled white vinegar, or cider vinegar
-1 cup sugar
-2 tsp vanilla extract
-2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder

Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 200ºF. Line 2 baking sheets with foil.

2. In a large bowl, beat egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy. Add vinegar; beat until soft peaks form. Increase speed to high and gradually add sugar; beat until glossy stiff peaks form. Beat in vanilla.

3. Remove half of meringue to another bowl; stir in cocoa until blended.

4. Spoon tablespoons of both meringues onto prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart each, making about 44 cookies – half vanilla-flavored and half cocoa-flavored. Or you can make marbleized cookies by spooning 1/2 tablespoon of each type of meringue into a mound and then swirling the 2 together with your fingers.

5. Bake until meringues feel dry and crisp all the way through, about 3 hours. Turn off oven; leave meringues in oven for 1 hour. Transfer baking sheets to wire racks to cool completely. Peel meringues off foil and store in an airtight container. Yields about 2 cookies per serving.
